# PitchCanvas
A pitch circle represents the chromatic scale, ascending in clockwise direction. One circle represents all transpositions. For more information, check out Miles Okazaki's Visual Reference for Musicians (p5).

Additional modules will appear here when created. See About, Instructions, and Upcoming Features below. I plan to make this open source and encourage collaboration!

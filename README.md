# PitchCanvas
A pitch circle represents the chromatic scale, ascending in clockwise direction. One circle represents all transpositions.

Additional modules will appear here when created. See About, Instructions, and Upcoming Features in the app's home page. I plan to make this open source and encourage collaboration!
